# Sign-Up Form

This project is from HTML and CSS curriculum at
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-connect-four).

## Description

I came across a project where I was asked to build a page with the layout
acheived (not mobile friendly).

The BIGGER 'challenge' was to make the form validatable.

Used few Quotes from Star Wars as I loved those movies :D
